Project description
---
This project consists in a simple web crawler that, given a starting URL, crawls all the 
pages it finds on the same domain. 

It has been implemented in Java 11 and consists of two main Maven modules:
 - a  `simple-crawler-lib` module containing a library that provides the web crawler functionality
 - a `web-crawler-app` module containing a console application based on Spring Boot that uses
  the crawling library to process the URL passed in the arguments
  
  Usage
  ---
  `java -jar web-crawler-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar rootUrl [maxConcurrentRequests] [requestTimeout (ms)] [userAgent]`
  
  Default config values:
  - `maxConcurrentRequests: 40`
  - `requestTimeout: 15000`
  - `userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/89.0.4389.114 Safari/537.36"`
  
  Building
  ---
  Building the project requires having Maven 3 and JDK 11 installed. Move into the project root 
  directory and run:
  
  `mvn package`
  
  The application jar will be generated in `web-crawler-app\target`.
  
  Unit tests
  ---
  The crawler library unit tests are run when building or when running `mvn test`.
  A code coverage report is generated by JaCoCo in `simple-crawler-lib\target\site\jacoco`.
